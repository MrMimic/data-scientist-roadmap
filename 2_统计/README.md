### Mean

In probability and statistics, population mean and expected value are used synonymously to refer to one __measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of the random variable__ characterized by that distribution.

For a data set, the terms arithmetic mean, mathematical expectation, and sometimes average are used synonymously to refer to a central value of a discrete set of numbers: specifically, the __sum of the values divided by the number of values__.

### Median

The median is the value __separating the higher half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution, from the lower half__. In simple terms, it may be thought of as the "middle" value of a data set.

### Descriptive statistics in Python

[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) is a python library widely used for statistical analysis.
