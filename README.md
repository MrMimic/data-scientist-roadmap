# data-scientist-roadmap

I just found this data science skills roadmap, drew by [Swami Chandrasekaran](http://nirvacana.com/thoughts/becoming-a-data-scientist/).

****

Jobs linked to __data science__ are becoming __more and more popular__. A __bunch of tutorials__ could easily complete this roadmap, helping whoever wants to __start learning stuff about data science__.

For the moment, a lot is __got on wikipedia__ (except for codes, always handmade). Any help's thus welcome!

## Rules

* Feel free to fork this repository and pull requests
* Always comment your code
* Please respect topology for filenames
